    Policies <br /><br />
    The Industrial Policy of Mizoram State was first notified on 15.3.1989 to
    give direction to the strategy for Industrial development of the State. It
    laid stress on reducing shifting cultivation by encouraging a shift from
    primary to secondary sectors while protecting the Socio-Cultural and ethnic
    identity of the indigenous enterprise of Mizoram. The intention of the
    Government in that policy was not Industrial growth per se but was rather
    directed towards all-round development of the people of Mizoram with special
    focus on upliftment of indigenous people and also towards giving them
    gainful employment and self employment opportunities in the Industries and
    allied sectors. Significant growth has been experienced as a result of this
    policy direction during 8th Plan period. <br /><br />

    In view of the National Industrial Policy which laid special emphasis for
    the development of Industries in the North Eastern Region, the Govt. of
    Mizoram had notified new Industrial Policy 2000 for accelerated Industrial
    and Economic development of the State. The main objectives of the New
    Industrial Policy of Mizoram 2000 are to engineer rapid sustainable growth
    of Industry in the State. It laid stress on encouraging Industries utilizing
    locally available raw materials. The Government had adopted the approach for
    identification of thrust areas and promoting them with fiscal and other
    incentives packages. Broad policy of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and
    Investment from outside the State has been adopted on Joint venture (JV)
    mode to safeguard the interest of the tribal population of Mizoram. Various
    administrative support system and market support system are also announced.
    <br /><br />

    With the introduction of New Industrial Policy of Mizoram 2000, a
    significant shift towards development of local resource base Industries has
    been achieved during 10th and 11th Five Year Plan. The overall Industrial
    growth has been experienced though it is much lower than the National
    average. <br /><br />

    The Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 was
    enacted by the Parliament in 2ndOctober 2006. This MSMED Act, 2006 has
    brought about comprehensive legal framework for the policies and promotional
    measures for Small & Medium Enterprises. The earlier concept of Industries
    has been changed to Enterprises. <br /><br />

    The Govt. of India has announced North East Industrial and Investment
    Promotion Policy (NEIIPP) on 1st April 2007 which envisages the package of
    fiscal incentives and other concessions for the North East Region. The Govt.
    of India has also laid stress upon the inclusive growth in its National
    agenda. <br /><br />

    The Govt. of Mizoram is mandated in giving sustainable employment and
    introducing better utilization of land by introducing New Land Use Programme
    (NLUP). The NLUP aimed at increasing Agriculture, Horticulture and livestock
    produce, better utilization of forest resources, plantation and development
    of Micro Enterprises at the rural level. <br /><br />

    In view of the large scale change in global Industrial scenario, National
    Industrial Policy and the economic development of the State, the Govt. of
    Mizoram feels necessary to announce new Industrial Development Policy for
    accelerated economic development of the State.
